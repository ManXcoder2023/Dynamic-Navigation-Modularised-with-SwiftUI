# Dynamic-Navigation-Modularised-with-SwiftUI

This code provides a structured approach for implementing navigation in modularized iOS apps. By modularizing the app, developers can separate different components and functionalities into self-contained modules, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.

By using a navigation coordinator, the code can handle different types of navigation, such as push, present, or deep linking, in a consistent and modular manner. It may also leverage protocols or interfaces to define navigation actions, allowing for easier unit testing and reducing dependencies between modules.
